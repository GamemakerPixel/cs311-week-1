        Phasmophobia is a ghost investigation game where the player is
        tasked with entering a map, collecting evidence, and using that
        evidence to determine what type of ghost is present.

        But the thing that makes this horror game really shine,
        in my opinion, is that you can play the game entirely without
        collecting evidence and still be 100% certain about the ghost type.

        In 3 of the 5 difficulties in the game, the ghost will have a 
        special interaction with three "evidence items" in the game. The
        player can then fill these in using their journal, which will tell
        them the exact ghost type. But, for players with an extensive
        knowledge of the game, it is possible to determine the ghost type
        with less than three evidence, or even with no evidence.

        Each ghost type has it's own differences in behavior during different
        aspects of the game. For example, some ghosts can hunt early under
        certain conditions, meaning they can hunt (try to kill the player)
        when the player has a sanity higher than 50. (Sanity starts at 100 and slowly decreases throughout
        the game based on conditions such as interacting with the ghost and
        standing in darkness.) For example, a demon can hunt below 70 sanity,
        well above the 50 where most ghosts can hunt. Demons also have a rare
        special ability allowing them to initiate a hunt at any sanity level.
        Thus, if a player notices a ghost hunt almost immediately, it may
        indicate that the ghost is a demon. Another type of ghost, a reventant,
        will hunt at half speed, until it gets line of sight with the player,
        at which point it will hunt at double speed. If a player notices this
        speed difference, they could identify the ghost as a revenant without
        collecting evidence. This game has a total of 24 ghost types, and they
        all have complex and interesting interactions with the various systems
        in the game, leading some to even consider it a puzzle game.
