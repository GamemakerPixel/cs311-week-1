        Without spoiling too much of the story, Oneshot is a game where you
        play as, well, yourself, and you guide Niko through a
        world neither of you are familiar with, that has lost its sun. It
        is your and Niko's task to restore the sun.

        Now, I've not seen many games that actively include the player in
        the story of the game, but perhaps the most impressive thing about
        Oneshot is how well it is able to sell this story to the player.

        While it may seem like a typical top-down rpg, it breaks the forth
        wall in several very creative ways I've never seen in a game before
        or after it. Here are a few (THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS):

      <ul>
        <li><p>Changing the desktop wallpaper to a puzzle solution</p></li>
        <li><p>Requiring the player to drag the window off screen to reveal numbers on a film</p></li>
        <li><p>Working with a second executable to guide the player through the ending</p></li>
        <li><p>Niko walking out of the game window and across your desktop during one of the endings</p></li>
      </ul>
