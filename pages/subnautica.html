        When the developers were designing Subnautica, they wanted to create
        a game without violence and weapons, to resist what they saw as a trend
        toward violence in video games. However, this decision would actually
        lead some people to classify this game as partly a horror game. Players
        best hope of surviving dangerous fauna is not to fight back, but to run
        away. This design, in combination with vast, dark areas in the game, create a
        strong sense of dread when entering unknown areas not often present in
        survival games.
