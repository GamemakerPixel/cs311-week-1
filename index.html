      <h1>Exploring the Design of my Favorite Games</h1>
      <p>
        In my many years of playing and developing games, I've always taken note of how
        games I enjoy are designed. Some of these games make some very smart design decisions
        that I believe other games, from myself and others, can learn from. On this website,
        I'd like to discuss some of the design takeaways from some of my favorite games.
